                    Hi there, my name's Luke. Welcome to my new blog. I'm unsure of how often I will
                     be posting here, but I'd like to think it would be fairly consistent. Anyway,
                      the idea behind this is just a place for me to let out my thoughts, and save
                       the trees along the way :D. I kind of got the idea for a blog journal thing
                        from my favourite movie, 'The Social Network', in which Mark Zuckerberg - 
                        played by my favourite actor, Jesse Eisenberg - creates Facebook. It's more
                         towards the beginning of the film that you see Zuckerberg actually posting
                          anything on his blog, and as a result dumps his girlfriend over it. I, 
                          however, am not planning on doing that. This will more be just a 
                           platform and place for my ideas and feelings and what not.

                <div class="desc">
                    After reading that back, again, I realised that I haven't really said much about 
                    myself; I basically just described 'The Social Network' movie. So, as I said, I 
                    am Luke. I'm on my way to being 18 - exciting, I know. Got big things planned this 
                    year, mainly in the summer. I'll hopefully go into more detail when the events arise. 
                    But, for the moment, not much is happening. I'm just getting on with life, to be 
                    truthful. Goin' with the waves - as I like to say.

                <div class="desc">
                    Today is the day when I actually publish this website, for the world to see. But, 
                    I'm already thinking about redesigning it. It just looks a bit too plain, and 
                    colourless. Now, I know blogs aren't really supposed to be really colourful, popping 
                    websites, but I think mine lacks a bit too much...

                <div class="desc">
                    So, the redesign went down. Not only on my blog but on all of my other websites. I 
                    basically just made everything screen size responsive. 
                    For those of you who are interested in how I did it: I just use % and vw/vh to scale 
                    things. I also found this super useful 'formula' for scaling font sizes: 
                    <pre><code style="background-color: #DDD;">font-size: calc([minimum size] + ([maximum size] - [minimum size]) * (([100vw - [minimum width]) / [maximum width])));</code></pre> 
                </div>
                    
            </div>

                <div class="desc">
                    Maltesers. I love your brand; and when I say love... I mean <b>love</b>! The chocolate 
                    is the best around and the sweet crunch of the biscuit-y goodness, inside, is heaven. 
                    I, first of all, wanted to thank you for having brought your incredible company and brand 
                    into this world. However, there is one slight issue I have with your products, and that is 
                    the uniformity of the Maltesers. Because of my disappointment in this area of their product, 
                    I decided to take to the customer services. Thankfully, they were very acceptable and 
                    understandable with my circumstance. Within a few days, I recieved a Â£5 voucher, fueling my 
                    apetite with even more Maltesers. So, once again, thank you, Maltesers.

                    Recently, I have come to realise my addiction to my phone - well, not so much an addiction, 
                    but I just use it rather a lot. To reduce this, I turned my phone to silent, and oh boy does 
                    it feel good. I used to pick up my phone whenever I heard a buzz or a ba-ding. Now, I look at 
                    it when <b>I</b> want to. It's only a very small change, but the results have felt rather 
                    promising. Other types to reduce screen usage, which I have read, include changing the colours 
                    on your phone and limiting the amount that you charge it. I would highly recommend trying out 
                    one of the methods, if you are looking to decrease your addiction, too.

                <div class="title-date"><h1>Good films are made of these...</h1><h2>18 / 02 / 19</h2></div>
                <div class="desc">
                    Good films. We each have our own set of favourite films, which we love for different reasons. But, 
                    at it's core, I think there is one main keystone thing that determines a good film for the rest: 
                    good films make you want to do something. That is, for me, after I watched 'The Social Network' 
                    (which I talked about in my very first blog post), I frantically wanted to create the next big social 
                    media hit. My brain was wirring with thoughts and ideas that could be the next thing to blow up and 
                    become a smash hit. Another example, which was the factor that made me realise all of this, is 'Creed'. 
                    'Creed' is a boxing movie, starring Michael B. Jordan, and if you haven't watched it, I would highly 
                    highly recommend you do ASAP. After watching 'Creed', the first thing I did was walk around my house, 
                    shadow boxing, whilst thinking about how breathtaking the movie was. It was so good, in fact, that the 
                    next day, I watched 'Creed II' - which I would recommend, if you liked the first one. Anyway, the point 
                    that I am trying to get at, here, is that if you came away from a movie, wanting to do something, then 
                    I would say that movie would be a good movie. Obviously there are many many exceptions and flaws to this 
                    rule, but I'd say that it works - at least for the most part.

                    Upon my recent trip to Falmouth University, I have made finally made a decision on which university I 
                    wish to study at... or did I? Well, it's a pretty scary thing - confirming where I'm going to be spending 
                    the next three or four years of your life. I know that I want to go to Falmouth, but I'm holding off 
                    firming it because of this. It's a weird thing - fear, anxiety or uncertainty - it holds you back from 
                    doing things that might normally be fairly easy to accomplish. On the flip side, we have adrenaline and 
                    excitement to give us the little push that we may need to do silly or reckless things. Emotions are crazy, 
                    so don't beat yourself down, if you don't know what to feel or know why you're feeling a certain way.

                    Master Oogway. Where do I start with you? Well, maybe I'll start where you started with Po. The quote that 
                    left me flabbergasted. "Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. But, today is a gift. That's why it is 
                    called the present." Now, I don't know how much this phrase has, can or will change my life/motives, but I 
                    can definitely say that it has been circling my mind for the past few days. My heart goes out to you,

                    7 years. 7. GODDAM. YEARS. And it's finally here. Borderlands 3. Gearbox, thank you! My favourite games, BL 
                    & BL2, are now being proceeded by a third (I don't count TPS). Now, they haven't said a release date yet, 
                    they've only released the trailer - which looks fricking awesome, might I add. Also, holy moly, that Mask of 
                    Mayhem trailer. Those graphics - I'm in awe. UHD for all previous games as well, I think I might be in love. 
                    This was the hype that I needed in my life, but maybe next, don't wait as long, Gearbox. Thanks, yours sincerely.
                    Luke.
