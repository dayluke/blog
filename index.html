                    Hi there, my name's Luke. Welcome to my new blog. I'm unsure of how often I will
                     be posting here, but I'd like to think it would be fairly consistent. Anyway,
                      the idea behind this is just a place for me to let out my thoughts, and save
                       the trees along the way :D. I kind of got the idea for a blog journal thing
                        from my favourite movie, 'The Social Network', in which Mark Zuckerberg - 
                        played by my favourite actor, Jesse Eisenberg - creates Facebook. It's more
                         towards the beginning of the film that you see Zuckerberg actually posting
                          anything on his blog, and as a result dumps his girlfriend over it. I, 
                          however, am not planning on doing that. This will more be just a 
                           platform and place for my ideas and feelings and what not.

            <div class="blog">

                <div class="title-date"><h1>So yeah...</h1><h2>29/01/2019</h2></div>
                <div class="desc">
                    After reading that back, again, I realised that I haven't really said much about 
                    myself; I basically just described 'The Social Network' movie. So, as I said, I 
                    am Luke. I'm on my way to being 18 - exciting, I know. Got big things planned this 
                    year, mainly in the summer. I'll hopefully go into more detail when the events arise. 
                    But, for the moment, not much is happening. I'm just getting on with life, to be 
                    truthful. Goin' with the waves - as I like to say.

                    Today is the day when I actually publish this website, for the world to see. But, 
                    I'm already thinking about redesigning it. It just looks a bit too plain, and 
                    colourless. Now, I know blogs aren't really supposed to be really colourful, popping 
                    websites, but I think mine lacks a bit too much...
